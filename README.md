## Welcome to Material 2

Material is an animation and graphics framework.

## About Material 2

The first version of Material was to bring Material Design to iOS. We considered that a great starting point, but not the entire story. Material 2 is the next chapter, which goes deeper into iOS with refined APIs that simplify Architecture, Photo Library, Reminders, Photo & Video, and much more. In addition to Material Design, we love Appleâ€™s flat UI. Having this in mind, we made it possible to accomplish both UI styles with ease.

## Our Mission

CosmicMind is setting out to build a seamless application platform, and Material is a major part of this effort. Material is the UI to our platform and will continue to advance itself through our growing community and project maintainers. We believe Material has a bright future and we are excited to openly share it with everyone.
