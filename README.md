# MaterialKit

Welcome to MaterialKit for iOS. MaterialKit is not just another components library. We built everything using an underlying graphics and animation framework to ensure extensibility and fuel everyone's imagination. MaterialKit is a new and exciting project for us at CosmicMind. We hope you love it as much as we do.

### Examples

Checkout an ever growing catalog of example code, and soon enough, we are opening to the community to share and explore what others are doing with MaterialKit.

### CocoaPods Support

MaterialKit is on CocoaPods under the name [MK](https://cocoapods.org/?q=MK).

### NavigationBarView

One of Material Design's greatest additions to UI is the NavigationBarView. In the examples folder, you can checkout some code to get you started with this wonderful component.
